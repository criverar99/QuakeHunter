# QuakeHunter
 
We, the team Tierra of the NASA Space Apps Challenge 2022, created this version of the QuakeHunter official program of the NASA making the following upgrades:

1. Changed the color palette for another one special for people with colorblind disease.
2. Fixed the seismic event bar at the beginning so you can display the specific information of the earthquake selected with the coursor
3. Changed the color selection function so it can be adapted to the magnitude ranges in the query
